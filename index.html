	<h2 style="color:MediumVioletRed;">Some Info About Me</h2>

	<p style="color:MediumVioletRed;">My name is Yulitsa Pantoja and I'm a second
		year student majoring in Communication Design with a concentration in Game
		Design.  I currently live in Greenfield California with my family.  Some fun
		activities I enjoy doing are drawing a bit, playing video games, reading,
		and watching shows, and being with my cats.  The game I am currently enjoying
		is Animal Crossing New Horizons.  My cats are named Kirby and Chi and got them
		in October 2014 when they were kittens and they are an important part of my
		family. </p>
