		<p>In this lab 10 I'm leaning about how to style my text elements for my website
		design.  Using rgb or hex color codes to have unlimited amount of color choices
		to use to color my website and using Adobe Color to help in visually seeing the
		colors and providing the hex/rgb code to paste into my css file.  Learning how to
		transform and space text to style my website.  And learning how to use differnt
		family fonts from Google by linking them for the sever to download the fonts
		to be able to set the text in that font style.</p>

		<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p>This lab wasn't very challenging I was building off from my last Lab9 file
		and experimenting the new ways to design and style my fonts spacing.  I simply
		went into my css codes file and added into my body a link of my fonts I wanted
		to use for my headers and paragraphs from Google's font link.  Added to my
		paragraphs letter, word, and height space to play with this new style I learned.</p>

		<h3>Problems</h3>
		<p>There was no problem while working on this Lab 10 everything was simple and
		the powerpoint was great reference to look at.  I'm getting better at create
		websites from these activty but later I will have problems for complexed codes
		that I'll have fun solving and improving my skills.</p>

		<h4>Results</h4>
		<p>As you can see my paragraphs and headers have a new fonts design.  The paragraph
		are more spaced out and the height is more streched out to make it more easier
		to read.  The headers are all capilized using the text tranformation to easily
		make them capilized.</p><br>
