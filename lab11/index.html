	<h2 id="center">Random Facts About Me</h2>
	<p>Some random stuff about me is my birthday is on July 24th and I'm introverted
	I like being at home in my room doing some activties on my own. I like to draw
	mostly using pencil and then scaning them to color digtial.  I don't consider
	myself very great at drawing but it's fun activty I enjoy to do whenever I have
	some free time. I really like cats and I have 2 of them Kirby and Chi and I feed
	the stray cats that come by during the night to pet them.  My favoirte seasons
	is autumn and winter it's not hot and I like seeing the leaves change to beautiful
	shades of orange, red, yellow, brown as they cover the ground.  And winter to wrap
	myself in my blanket as I play videogames and enjoy drinking some hot
	chocolate.  My favorite GameCube game to play with people is Kirby Air Ride
	I wished there was a Kirby Air Ride 2 game it's so much fun.</p>

	<h1>Lab 11: Advanced Block-Level Styling 1</h1>
		<div class="border">
		<p>In this lab 11 I'm learning about how to position my elements using sticky,
		relative, fixed, and absolute and know how they affect my website. The
		different display properties like inline-block, block, inline, and none to
		affect how things are displayed and organized.  Also adjusting relative
		sizes minimum and maximum to adjusting sizes when device is smaller to fit
		perfectly and inlarge when more space.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="border">
		<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p>This lab wasn't very challenging I was building off from my last Lab 10 file
		but adding more css codes and added a sticky to my home page and this lab's CSS code
		file to always be at the top even while scrolling down like a website menu.  Adding a
		paragraph about some random facts about me to the side using a aside tag with an
		id to adjust the color and add border.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="border">
		<h3>Problems</h3>
		<p>I didn't have any problems while working on this Lab 11 everything was simple and
		the powerpoint was great reference to look at.  It was mostly adding few css
		codes to change my elements to be position, displayed, and setting minimum
		to get small when viewing this page on a phone and still look good.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="border">
		<h4>Results</h4>
		<p>As you can see in my Lab 11 you can scroll down and the buton links while
		always be at the top no matter what and they both work.  And there is my
		random facts about me on the side to read.</p><br>
