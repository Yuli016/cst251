	<p>I prefer evenings and night time because it's colder and especially nighttime
	because everyone at home is mostly asleep for me to have a quiet night to work on
	stuff.  One of my favorite food is a sandwhich with ham since it's simple to make
	to eat for lunch.  I like drinking my coffee cold rather than hot.  One of my favorite
	color is like a mint green. I like listening to videogames soundtracks on Youtube.  I used
	to have 2 hamsters but they died of old age.  I used to have three cats, a dog, hamsters,
	rabbit, bird, fishes as pets before having Kirby and Chi.</p>

	<h1>Lab 12: Advanced Block-Level Styling 2</h1>
		<div class="border">
		<p>In this lab 12 I'm learning about how to how to center elements and images
		vertical, horizontaly, and both using css codes. I want to understand more about
		centering to fully know how to position my elements and images in any way I
		want.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="border">
		<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p>This lab was a bit tricky to me I knew how to set up the divs to be 30 percent
		each and making the images 150px wide.  But looking back at the powerpoint, w3schools,
		and video I understood to use the code reference in the slides to use to be
		able to center my images and paragraph.  But unsure if this is what exactly I'm
		supose to do just adding a div to float, div to center my text, div to center an image
		horizontaly, and a div with an image to center both horizontaly and vertical.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="border">
		<h3>Problems</h3>
		<p>I didn't have some issue trying to center my images was the main problem.
		The slides were very short and not very informative for my to understand more
		but with the video and powerpoint it did help me do my lab 12.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="border">
		<h4>Results</h4>
		<p>As you can see in my Lab 12 it's the same as my other lab 11 but with 4 more
		divs with paragraphs,images and more random facts about me.  All my other 4 divs
		are 30% wide and everything is centered with the background color to help show
		the position of it.</p><br>
