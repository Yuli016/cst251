	<h1>Lab 13: Typography I</h1>
		<div class="border">
		<p>In this lab 13 I'm recreating a website page just by looking at the image.
			Using what I know now to create a fake website page to look real.</p>
		</div>

		<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p>This lab was by far the hardest I have done to try and recreate a website
			 because this one has so many elements to organize to put.  But I challenged
			 myself to try to recreate this website.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="border">
		<h3>Problems</h3>
		<p>Most of the problem I had was the container of the elements to resize them
			in any format so it looks great in any device to stay scaled proported.  The
			canyan photo on the bottom right does stay in the corner but scaling it
			doesn't stay next to the campfire picture so it doesn't show the background
			color.  The biggest help in doing this lab was Wes example on the model
			because I inspected to check the codes to show on this page and seeing the
			css codes. Looking at CSS codes helped make the website be one screen page
			and making the containers for each elments and helped me make the campfire
			picture take up half the screen and stay that way while in differnt devices.</p>

		<h4>Results</h4>
		<p>As you can see in my Lab 13 I got to the result as close as I could to look
			I feel proud about it there is still more for me to learn.  I would want
			to go back later to fix the canyon photo to stay in it's place even if it's
			scaled but everything eles seems to be working great.</p>
