	<h1>Lab 14: Typography II</h1>
		<div class="border">
		<p>In this lab 14 I'm recreating another website page just by looking at the
		image. And using my skills that I currently know to try to create the codes.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="border">
		<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p>This lab was a bit more easier than the other fake website I had to recreate
			it was mostly centering things in the center of the page.  But the most
			tricky and hardest part was center the "OOO" and "Out Of Office" to be in
			center and be side by side even by scaling the website in differnt devices
			screens to look great.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="border">
		<h3>Problems</h3>
		<p>Most of was kind of simple it wasn't too hard and also not easy like that
			part but the others were easier to do.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="border">
		<h4>Results</h4>
		<p>As you can see in my Lab 14 I mostly look good rescaling the website but the
			"OOO" and "Out Of Office" couldn't make stay in it's position so I could try
			later to re do that part because I was so confused how to do it.</p>
