	<h1>Lab 15: Fancy CSS 1</h1>
		<div class="border">
		<p>In this lab 15 I'm learing how to apply text shadows, box shadow, gradients,
		filters, rounded corners, object fit, and transform into my codes to apply to
		to my elements.</p>
		</div>

		<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p>This lab was not very hard to complete all of the steps were mostly in
		the powerpoint which was very helpful. I had fun completing this assignments
		testing new css codes like my favorite one was the object-box to allow me to
		have all my images the same size even when having differnt sized images.</p>

		<h3>Problems</h3>
		<p>One of the problems I had is I wanted to make an image be a background for
		a div using an image from a website link.  I didn't know how to set the image
		as a background before so I looked up how to make an image be a background and
		learned how to do it in w3schools. I saw the code and wrote it but the next
		problem was the images was repeating 3 smaller sizes of it top and bottom and
		not taking the whole space.  I looked back at the code in w3school example and
		saw my problem I added to the CSS codes to make the images not repeat and to
		cover it. After saving the file and reloading the images was taking up the
		whole space and didn't repeated and it was ready for me to upload the the severs.</p>

		<h4>Results</h4>
		<p>As you can see in my Lab 15 you can see all of my effects in a single section
		of my website.  All of my small animal images use object fit, box shadow, filters
		like blur and saturate, it's tranformed by being rotated 5 degree, and has rounded
		corners.  My text "Arctic Animals" uses text shows to give it a black outline
		to the text, and finially my backgroud of my website uses a gradient effect if you
		look at the left side it's lighter and going right it turns darker. This website
		has being test locally and is ready to be upload to my Github sever page.</p>
