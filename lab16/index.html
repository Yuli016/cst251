	<h1>Lab 16: Fancy CSS 2</h1>
		<div class="border">
		<p>In this lab 16 I'm learing more CSS codes like how to make an image be a background,
		different effects for elements using transitions, making animations for elements,
		and making columns for text.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="border">
		<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p>This lab was a bit hard to do but the only easy things were how to make the
		text into columns and how to make the image as a background.  The transition
		was difficult to do since I didn't know what kinds of things I could do so I looked
		for examples to give me some ideas.  I saw the rotating transition and thought about
		making a star rotate by adjusting the rotating degrees to be more while it was hovered
		over it.  The animation wasn't too hard I created a div for it so that it will
		only move inside of it.  And using the w3schools I used the example of a square
		going around clockwise and copied the codes and adjusted the animation keyframes for
		the left and top and retested over and over until it was perfect. Other website
		examples were great for reference and jsfiddle perfect for test them.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="border">
		<h3>Problems</h3>
		<p>The one I had the most problem was the transtion to make the text slowy
		go down without it to just appear at it's location because I wanted it to slowly
		move down. I was struggling until I figure it out when I was looking on the internet
		for examples I saw one kind of what I wanted but it was going horizontal instead
		of vertical.  I copied the codes and changed the (5,0) to (0,5) to only make it move
		verical and adjusted some of how much I wanted it to go down, and the transition speed.
		After saving and loading the page again it was working great and adjust more of the
		height to move more down to be hidden.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="border">
		<h4>Results</h4>
		<p>As you can see in my Lab 16 when you go to the section where there is a pixel
		background.  It has all of my learned skills I used transition to make the star
	 	at the top right corner spin 1800 degrees when you hover over it and when you are
		not hovering over it does a backward 1800 degree to be in it's orginal position.
		I made the text be into 3 columns and I added a transition transform: translate(0, 43em)
		going at a linear speed while it slowly floated down and when it reaches the bottom
		of the pixel background the text is hidden like in a videogame screen or a movie
		and quickly goes back up. Finally the animation I added was a kirby images that
		goes clockwise around the pixel background infinite. I really enjoyed doing
		this lab learning especially transitions and animations and it's complicated but fun.</p>
