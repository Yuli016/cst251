		<h1>Lab 17: CSS (Float)</h1>
		<p>In this Lab 17 how use a skectch layout to get an idea for our layout to
			create and dividing parts into header, footer, nav, main, sections, and
			aside.  Also using seperate html files with the same layout to organize using
			CSS using float, flexbox, and grid properties.</p>

		<h1>Challenges</h1>
		<p>Some of the challenges in the float html section was having the main and
		aside sections to be side by side but looking at the slides did help with
		adjusting the widths for each section for main 56% and aside 39% and setting
		the height to auto.  Putting the nav inside the by making it absolute to put
		it at the top right to be inside the header sections with all the other links
		working.</p>

		<h3>Results</h3>
		<p>As you can see in my Lab Float I have organized my layout based on the
		sketch I drew using float to have the header on top with the nav inside of
		it.  Having the main section take up more than half left side and having the
		the three sections divided with in the main.  On the right side to have the
		aside with all my images of my work.  And at the bottom my footer with some
		of my contact information.</p>
