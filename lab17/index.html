		<h1>Lab 17: CSS (Index)</h1>
		<p>In this Lab 17 how use a skectch layout to get an idea for our layout to
			create and dividing parts into header, footer, nav, main, sections, and
			aside.  Also using seperate html files with the same layout to organize using
			CSS using float, flexbox, and grid properties.

		<h1>Challenges</h1>
		<p>The challenging parts was mosty in the other section float, and flexbox
		html to orgainze my layout page using the css float and flex properties.  Also
		making sure all of the other html files links worked propertly and the layouts
		were working.</p>

		<h2>Problelms</h2>
		<p>Most of the other problems were in the other sections the flexbox was the
		most challenging it was confusing in how to use the css codes to make flex be
		in it's position. The powerpoint useful in figure out to make the the boxes
		aside and main to set it's box size and using background color and borders to
		the box effects.</p>

		<h3>Results</h3>
		<p>As you can see in my Lab 17 Index section this one has the basic layout
		and has the picture images of my layout design to do using float.  All of the
		links work and take you the other layout with basically the same design layout
		but using other different CSS codes like float, flex, and grids.</p>
