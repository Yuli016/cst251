      <p id="paragraph">Hello I am Ayokemi Popoola, I am 20 and live in Los Angeles California.
        I'm a Communication Design major and in my third year. At
        CSUMB I am on the track and field team. I enjoy painting and going to the beach
        with frineds. I recently been binge watching a lot of Netflix and just
        rollerskating with my dogs Max and Leah. I'm lowkey nervous about this class
        but I know at the end I will enjoy learning new things.

      <p id="paragraph">My names is Yulitsa Pantoja currently 19 and I live
        in Greenfield California with my family. I'm a second year CSUMB student
        majoring in Communication Design with a concentration in Game Design. Some
        fun activities I enjoy doing is draw a bit, play video games, read,
        and watching shows, and being with my cats. My cats names are Kirby and Chi
        and they are both actually siblings and I got them in October 2014 when they
        were kittens. The game I'm currently enjoy playing is Animal Crossing New
        Horizons. It will be fun learning how to write codes and design websites.
