		<h1>Lab 20: Team Project Sketches</h1>
		<div class="border">
			<p>In this lab 20 I'm just doing quick sketches for my layout design for my website
			project as a prototype so it will still be changing.  So before I actully start
			coding the design on my laptop I'll have a idea to quickly create it based on the
			feedback I get by my teammates and also provide to each of them some feedback.
			So we can combine our works to all agree on the layout for our website.</p>

			<h2>Challenges</h2>
			<p>This lab the challenging part was thinking how to design the layout for my team
			website project.  And how to quickly draw out my sketches quick for my homepage,
			content for cartoons, and Webtoons recommdenation to orgainze them in way that
			provided informaiton about each show/story while thinking the format in desktop
			and phone design.  But the html and css were easy to create with all my sketches
			and captions to describe what the sketches are.</p>

			<h3>Problems</h3>
			<p>My main problems was thinking about some ideas of corse it didn't have to be
			super detailed but just some genreal layout designs and some notes for reference
			espically since the sketches are messy.  I did know I have to orgainzed the
			information about the show/story because it's what I'm recommeding but I'm
			always going to change the design and layout based on my teams feedback to better
			improve them and work together to help each with good layout design so people viewing
			website can have fun exploring the differnt media we like to share and help making
			quarantine a little less boring by being entertained.</p>
		</div>

			<h4>Results</h4>
			<p>As you can see in my Lab 20 I successful added my images of my layout design
			while these are just some ideas to work with it will later improve by the feedback
			of my teammates so that I can developed a more detailed and orgainzed layout for my
			content pages.  So that I can start getting my suggested shows and stories from
			Webtoon to share.  Because our website is about media and the entertainment we
			can share with other people so they can not be bored during this quarantine.</p>
