	<h1>Lab 21: Draft Team Project Sketches</h1>
		<div class="border">
		<p>In this lab 21 I'm detailing more about the layout design for the website
		of the homepage, designer, and my two contents I'm doing. Based on the
		feedback of my quick sketches I'm organizing the my ideas of the design and
		the functions for each page. Also thinking about the different size of the
		layout on devices to be responsive.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="border">
		<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p>Most of my challenge was to draw my layout ideas for the team and detailing
		my ideas on paper of the layout design and write about the function it will
		have. Also taking the layout idea I drew on paper and thinking about the
		design for different devices like ipad and phones so it stays the same even
		in different screen sizes.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="border">
		<h3>Problems</h3>
		<p>Some problems for me were mainly trying to draw my ideas on paper to
		visually show my team what I thought our website could look like since we are
		combining many media together as a magazine layout. But I don't know how much
		each of us should make or if we officially choose our media to cover so that
		if I need to make another I'll know which other type of media I could cover next.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="border">
		<h4>Results</h4>
		<p>In my drawing you can see my notes of my ideas and function for some things
		I wanted to include. And saved the scan as pdf and edited to type my notes
		instead of writing it on paper to have more space and to re edit it later
		without redoing it again on the same document. None of them are perfect since
		we can add more things for some pages or use some of my ideas while using
		someone else's layout idea.</p>

			<h4>My Notes</h4>
			<p>These are just my ideas for constructing a constant design for some pages,
			the homepage, designers page, and my two other content ideas. None of these
			designs are the final product of the project unless everyone on my team
			wants to use these design layouts which then we can just build more on these
			ideas.  I also thought about the different layout design on different devices
			and will have the same functions. Since responsive is important for websites
			to have for people to view on their devices.</p>
