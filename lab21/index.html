	<h1>Lab 21: Draft Team Project Sketches</h1>
		<div class="border">
		<p>In this lab 20 I'm just doing quick sketches for my layout design for my website
		project as a prototype so it will still be changing.  So before I actully start
		coding the design on my laptop I'll have a idea to quickly create it based on the
		feedback I get by my teammates and also provide to each of them some feedback.
		So we can combine our works to all agree on the layout for our website.</p>

		<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p>This lab was a bit tricky to me I knew how to set up the divs to be 30 percent
		each and making the images 150px wide.  But looking back at the powerpoint, w3schools,
		and video I understood to use the code reference in the slides to use to be
		able to center my images and paragraph.  But unsure if this is what exactly I'm
		supose to do just adding a div to float, div to center my text, div to center an image
		horizontaly, and a div with an image to center both horizontaly and vertical.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="border">
		<h3>Problems</h3>
		<p>I didn't have some issue trying to center my images was the main problem.
		The slides were very short and not very informative for my to understand more
		but with the video and powerpoint it did help me do my lab 12.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="border">
		<h4>Results</h4>
		<p>As you can see in my Lab 12 it's the same as my other lab 11 but with 4 more
		divs with paragraphs,images and more random facts about me.  All my other 4 divs
		are 30% wide and everything is centered with the background color to help show
		the position of it.</p>
