	<h1>Lab 3 File Structure</h1>
		<div id="border">
		<p>This lab was created to make a local file structure on my computer and add
			 index.html files to organize my files and create links to my other labs on
			 my home page. </p>
		</div>
		<div id="border">
		<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p>It was simple in creating the file structure because
			most of it was already prepared when I downloaded it.  Some of the difficulty I had
			was writing the codes to make my links work and to make my pictures show up. I
			followed writing the codes for each lab and had difficulty to make lab 3 show up
			but I simply fixed this issue by naming correctly my index.html because I accidently
			typed it wrong.  My images after looking over how to correctly link the images to the
			correct folders they were now showing on my home page.</p>

		<div id="border">
		<h3>Results</h3>
			<p>Currently you are looking at my index.html file I created and itâ€™s
			properly working.  This page is my Lab 3 File Structure with an image at
			the bottom of my file structure screenshot on my computer and describing
			the challengers I had while creating this.</p>
