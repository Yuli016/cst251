<h1 style="color:MidnightBlue;">Lab 3 File Structure</h1>
	<p style="color:MidnightBlue;">This lab was created to make a local file structure
		on my computer and add index.html files to organize my files and create links to
		my other labs on my home page. </p>

<h2 style="color:MidnightBlue;">Challenges</h2>
	<p style="color:MidnightBlue;">It was simple in creating the file structure because
		most of it was already prepared when I downloaded it.  Some of the difficulty I had
		was writing the codes to make my links work and to make my pictures show up. I
		followed writing the codes for each lab and had difficulty to make lab 3 show up
		but I simply fixed this issue by naming correctly my index.html because I accidently
		typed it wrong.  My images after looking over how to correctly link the images to the
		correct folders they were now showing on my home page.</p>

<h3 style="color:MidnightBlue;">Results</h3>
	<p style="color:MidnightBlue;">Currently you are looking at my index.html file
		I created and itâ€™s properly working.  This page is my Lab 3 File Structure with
		an image at the bottom of my file structure screenshot on my computer and describing
		the challengers I had while creating this.</p>
