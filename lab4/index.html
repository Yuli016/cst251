	<h1>Lab 4: File Transfer</h1>
		<div id="border">
		<p>This Lab 4 File Transfer is to demonstrate I have
		learned how to push my files to work on the severs perfectly.  By working in
		Atom to create the codes and after testing them repeatedly until everything
		is working to finally use Github to push my files to the servers for other
		people to see like right now. </p>

		<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p>While working to create my lab 4 file transfer I didn’t
			have much issue in coding correctly because the format was similar to lab 3 file
			structure codes.  The only difference is the screenshots I had to change because
			it was not going to be link to help but while working on my lab 4 when ever I
			had to screenshot my process I always named them correctly and stored them
			into my lab 4 img folder and went back to my codes to write the source of my
			images and capitol them so the words at the bottom of that images shows what
			the photo is.  After finishing my codes I tested my codes by opening them in
			my browser and everything was working perfectly. I pushed on my “Back To
			Home Page” which is seen above the first screenshot and it did go to my
			home page.  On my homepage I tested my other labs 2 and 3 to see if they
			also worked and inspecting them they also worked.  So I was ready to
			upload my files to the servers by opening my github and writing my summary
			and committing to master and push origin.  I went to my website in github
			and looked to see if the url is an actual url instead on my desktop files.</p>

		<h3>Results</h3>
		<p>As you can see on my Lab 4 all my 4 screenshots are
		showing perfectly with the caption at the bottom of them and my paragraphs
		and headers too.  You can test yourself that my links to my home page are
		working and return back by pushing the Lab 4 link.  I did push my files on
		my computer to the servers because how would you be seeing this page if I
		didn’t push it to the servers and can see my url link on my github.</p>
