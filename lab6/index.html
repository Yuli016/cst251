			<h1>Lab 6: More Complicated HTML</h1>
			<img id="cat" src="img/kirby.jpg">
			<p>In this lab 6 to learn more complicated HTML codes
				to demonstrate how to use to create forms and show results in google search
				and linking index.css to organize how pictures and text to a certain style
				and having a a back to homepage button and upload the files to the severs
				after checking everything is working properly local.</p>
			<h2>Challenges</h2>
			<p>While working on lab 6 adding the image was easy,
				writing the paragraphs about the process, and linking to go back to the
				homepage was easy.  The new challenging thing was creating the form and
				to submit and check if it was working property.  I looked back at the
				powerpoint talking about how to create a form and used the link in Slack
				to see how the forum is created and looked closely and wrote the code to
				practice instead of copying and pasting.  Changed up some of the questions
				and wrote about favorite seasons, write about your shows in textarea, passwords,
				name, and color with the text to be that color to
				color code them. Linked the index.css to lab 6 and messed with some of the setting
				to fix my text from leaving the box by making the box bigger, making the text size
				smaller, and adjusting the size of my picture on the right.</p>
			<h3>Results</h3>
			<p>As you can see in my lab 6 I have all my writing
				explaining my about the lab, results and challenges and a picture of a cat
				on the right side in a box.  At the bottom is my form using a lot of differnt types to click and you can take and
				submit a button to get results from google working properly.  All of my
				screenshots at the bottom showing my process and link to the homepage all
				uploaded in my Github account server.</p>
