		<h1>Lab 6: More Complicated HTML</h1>
		<p>In this lab 6 to learn more complicated HTML codes
		to demonstrate how to use to create forms and show results in google search
		and linking index.css to organize how pictures and text to a certain style
		and having a a back to homepage button and upload the files to the severs
		after checking everything is working properly local.</p>

		<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p>While working on lab 6 adding the image was easy,
		writing the paragraphs about the process, and linking to go back to the
		homepage was easy.  The new challenging thing was creating the form and
		to submit and check if it was working property.  I looked back at the
		powerpoint talking about how to create a form and used the link in Slack
		to see how the forum is created and looked closely and wrote the code to
		practice instead of copying and pasting.  Changed up some of the questions
		and wrote about favorite seasons, write about your shows in textarea, passwords,
		name, and color with the text to be that color to
		color code them. Linked the index.css to lab 6 and messed with some of the setting
		to fix my text from leaving the box by making the box bigger, making the text size
		smaller, and adjusting the size of my picture on the right.</p>

		<h3>Results</h3>
		<p>As you can see in my lab 6 I have all my writing explaining my about the
		lab, results and challenges and a picture of a cat on the right side in a box.
		At the bottom is my form using a lot of differnt types to click and you can
		take and submit a button to get results from google working properly.  All of
		my screenshots at the bottom showing my process and link to the homepage all
		uploaded in my Github account server.</p>
