		    <p>In this lab 7 starting to learn CSS and linking a CSS file to file to use
          id and class to style my website.</p>
			<h2>Challenges</h2>
			<p>The only challenging part of this lab was writing the codes in the css file
        and knowing what to write to style the website and reloading the page lots
        of time to see the changes and looking other ways to style it.</p>
      <h3>Problems</h3>
      <p>Some problem I had was trying to fix the screenshots to not be applied
        with same effects.  So I created a new id to stop it from being in the right
        side and added caption at the bottom and style it. </p>
			<h4>Results</h4>
			<p>Currently if you are seeing my page and reading this you can see how the color
      background is a light blue and my cat image and all my text are inside a light oranage box.
      Using inspect you can see my codes used and see that I used a index.css to link into my file
      to style my website to how I want it and saved and tested it local and updated to the severs.</p>
