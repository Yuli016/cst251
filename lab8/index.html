		<h1>Lab 8: CSS Selectors</h1>
		<img id="plant" class="zoom" src="img/plant.jpg">
		<p>In this lab 8 learning I'm learning how to use CSS selectors to decorate
		my website using a link to my css file.  By applying many elements using class
		and id to link multipualy elments together and even elements within each other.</p>
		<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p>This lab was very challenging for me thinking how to style my website using
			CSS sectors by writing the inputs to effect the element inside another element.
			And thinking about what other effects I can do and how to write in code since
			I don’t really know the lots of functions to create the effects so using tutorial
			was helpful for me to see the codes and use for my website.  I like looking
			back at the slides and seeing and thinking about the different selectors are
			typed and the effects of what they do.  </p>
		<h3>Problems</h3>
		<p>Some of the problems I had was trying to put the images side by side but looking
		at the tutorials in w3schools it helped me in how to organize the images using divs
		with class in css.  How to use the css seletors to affect the website with the
		design and changing the input names and adding the ids, classes to match with
		what I want it to affect within another elements.</p>
		<h4>Results</h4>
		<p>As you can see the design of my website you can hover over my plant image
			and it will get bigger and smaller when you don’t hover over it and the
			“Back To Home Page” changes color when hovering over it.  I am happy with
			the design and colors used and later learning even more complicated functions
			to decorate a website instead of simply changing colors, adding borders, or
			changing fonts to make it more prettier using css selectors to help stylize
			it easier.</p>
