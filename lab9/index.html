		<p>In this lab 9 I'm learning how to style block elements into their own divs
			to make it easier to design my websites using html and css codes to organize
			it sturcture buy writing the codes and linking them to css file.  It's important
			to understand the sturcture when working with thousands codes organize and easily
			see the effects to change when you want.</p>

			<h2>Challenges</h2>
			<p>This lab wasn't very challenging I just added the divs in each sectoions
			to be within it's own box and playing with the margins, and padding to see the
			effects.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="border">
			<h3>Problems</h3>
			<p>Some issue I had was adding the a new div to only affect the design for
			the headers and pargraphs to box them in each one.  Looking over the slides
			to reference back it was easy to just add the divs and close them in each header
			and paragraphs.  While continue to style the box's design and adjusting the
			the magins and paddings.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="border">
			<h4>Results</h4>
			<p>As you can see my paragraphs and headers are within a div block with
			same style by puting div class border and in my css creating a style with
			the name border to change the background color,border, and adjusting the
			magins.  Everything else is with a a div and is styled to how it looks in
			website design.</p><br>
