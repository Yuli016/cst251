      <h2>Revisiting Game of Thrones</h2>

      <p>Game of Thrones made an immense impact on popular culture during its release but one question that remained in my mind was,
      Does this show still hold up?  I must say, rewatching the series from start to finish was an excellent experience, particularly
      picking up on themes and motifs that I missed on the first watch through was an eye-opener and as a whole the first four seasons
      were nothing short of greatness.<br><br>

      As the series progressed through the cannon material from the books written by George R.R. Martin,
      it never failed to keep me wanting to see what was going to happen next. The show did an excellent job of juggling multiple perspectives
      and story lines while simultaneously keeping them cohesive. Characters like Jon Snow, Brandon Stark, Daenerys Targareyan, and Cersei
      Lannister were always developing their personalities and impact on the show while almost never letting the view catch a breath. Although
      the later half of the series felt less fleshed out and magical as the first, that feeling of being on the edge of your seat never truly
      faded away. As a whole the show for sure can still be enjoyed and experienced as it was, even with the later seasons not being as amazing
      as the first four. As a whole the show is a solid 4 out of 5 stars as long as you can be content with the endings of multiple storylines
      not being as amazing as when they started.</p>
