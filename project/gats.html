      <h2>Graffiti Against The System: GATS - Oakland Icon</h2>
      <p>Graffiti Against The System (GATS) is an Oakland based graffiti artist
      known for the face/mask character he paints around the bay and his conscious
      approach to graffiti art. He does not claim to be a savant or an expert in the
      subject, he is well known because his work speaks for itself and is an iconic
      figure in the Bay Area graffiti scene because of his ability to get his pieces
      up and stay up.  He began writing his moniker GATS in Los Angeles 2005 but since
      then has had multiple contemporary gallery productions and shows. He has been interviewed
      by established magazines and had a small documentary series back in 2012 depicting his
      work writing a powerful poem across the city of Oakland following the Oscar Grant shooting.
      The mask character he draws symbolizes a few things, its first an anti-establishment
      statement. In his own words taken from the docu series in 2012, “It represents double
      identity...I associate masks with the freedom of speech. Because it is the only time you
      can speak freely without being persecuted, and so I will never take mine off ”. The tears
      drawn on the characters represent the lost lives of loved ones, people wronged by the system
      and wisdom. The teeth, beard or tentacles coming down from the face symbolize experience and
      wisdom gained over time. His bold thick lines and incredibly detailed work is iconic and
      something to admire. GATS will continue to be a presence in the Bay Area and as his work
      continues to find more and more professional recognition, he is slowly becoming a
      graffiti artist worthy of an all time great title. </p>
